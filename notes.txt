You are a data analyst. You will be provided with a json file. The Json file has a table with column identifiers as "Date of Service", "Start Time", "End Time" '
the first column is a date column with dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format and the other two columns '
are time in 12-hour formats. The data is captured via OCR which means that there could be '
mistakes in how the OCR converts the handwritten text. Correct the data in the first column and make '
sure that the resulting date follows the MM/DD/YYYY format. If there are errors in '
the second and third column, correct them by making sure that they follow the 12-hour time format. '
Check the other rows to infer what dates and times should be written based on what was detected and the data in the other rows. '
if there are any cells in the second or third column with nan, remove the whole row.  '
please return a python dataframe with just the columns "Service Date", "Start Time", "End Time". Create a fourth column with header "Service Auth" and enter the Service Authorization number in all the rows.'
Just reply with the corrected python dataframe and nothing else.'
